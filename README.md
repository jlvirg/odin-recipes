TOP Practice
I first started this in another repo but became confused by the commit/push processes I had done the night before, which was inevitable when I had gone to bed without committing any changes (and there were substantial changes). So I am starting fresh, with a very simple recipe website that uses a dropdown menu to select recipes, and a button that will take them to the selected page.
This is a beginner's lesson, however given my experience with HTML and CSS, I thought I'd make it somewhat more complex and "pretty" it up.
